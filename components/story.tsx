                    My background is in business and customer value management across fintech and telecommunications. I’ve led
                    lifecycle and retention programs end‑to‑end—owning campaigns, segmentation, and measurement—always with a
                    simple goal: build products customers love and that move the metrics that matter.

                    Along the way, I taught myself how to design and ship software. I went deep into AI and full‑stack development—
                    from FastAPI backends, agents and retrieval to React/Next.js UI, Tailwind/Shadcn design systems, and modern
                    product workflows. That mix lets me translate customer problems into shipped features quickly, and validate
                    ideas with real users instead of slide decks.

                    Today I bring those two worlds together: business context and hands‑on engineering. I care about clarity and
                    outcomes—clean interfaces, measurable improvements, and customer experiences that feel effortless. Whether it’s
                    a lifecycle program that boosts retention, or an AI‑powered workflow that removes friction, I’m happiest when
                    I can connect the dots from insight to impact.
